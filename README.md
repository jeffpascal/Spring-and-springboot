## Spring-and-springboot

Course to understand spring and spring boot. Here i will have my notes

### Dependency injection


```
public class ComplexBusinessService{
  SortAlgorithm sortAlgorithm;
```

- ComplexBusiness Class uses the sortAlgorithm. ComplexBusiness depends on sortAlgorithm

- SortAlgorithm class is a dependency of ComplexBusinessService because it needs to make use of it to sort something

- What are all the things it needs to perform the functionality

- Before (without Spring) we would need to instatiate SortAlgorithm to create a dependancy. This is called **Tight-coupling** which is not considered good.

- **Loose coupling** is considered good. We do this by removing the instantiation and creating a constructor


```
public class ComplexBusinessService{
  SortAlgorithm sortAlgorithm; // = new BubbleSortAlgorithm(); //tight coupling
  
  public ComplexBusnessService(SortAlgorithm sortAlgorithm){
    this.sortAlgorithm = sortAlgorithm;
    } //example of loose coupling
```
